## R Markdown


```{r sda }
df.train <- read.csv('titanic_train.csv')
head(df.train)
library(Amelia)
missmap(df.train, main="Titanic Training Data - Missings Map", col=c("yellow", "black"), legend=FALSE)
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$disp)

```

```{}

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
